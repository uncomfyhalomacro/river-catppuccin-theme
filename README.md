# river-catppuccin-theme

A sample configuration and theme for [river](https://github.com/riverwm/river), a tiling window manager for wlroots based Wayland compositors written in [Zig](https://github.com/ziglang/zig/).

## Prerequisites

You must have the following software in order to make this work:

- Spotify (you can replace it with any spotify client e.g. spotifyd, spotify-tui for added waybar spice)
- [playerctl](https://github.com/altdesktop/playerctl) (needed for playback stuff. Available usually in the official repositories)
- [river-tag-overlay](https://git.sr.ht/~leon_plickat/river-tag-overlay) (for showing pop-ups about the currently focused and occupied tags)
- [stacktile](https://git.sr.ht/~leon_plickat/stacktile) (more powerful layout generator for river)
- [fnott](https://codeberg.org/dnkl/fnott) (a keyboard driven notification daemon for wayland)
- [foot](https://codeberg.org/dnkl/foot) (a native wayland terminal emulator)
- [yambar](https://codeberg.org/dnkl/yambar) (a lightweight bar using YAML as a configuration format)
- [wbg](https://codeberg.org/dnkl/wbg) (a simple wallpaper application for wlroots. You can replace it with swaybg as that has more features)
- [wob](https://github.com/francma/wob) (custom levels for volume/backlight/progress)
- [fuzzel](https://codeberg.org/dnkl/fuzzel) (simple rofi/dmenu inspired launcher)
- For screenshots, install slurp, wayshot, swappy, and notify-send
- A nerd font like Hack Nerd Font

Note: Read the scripts if you want to modify something.
